  <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
  <h3>I am a little confused.</h3>
  <p>It’s another busy but not rich week, I have some things to say.</p>
    <p>Realizing that a lot of events stopped at part.To advertise for the Department of Advertisement,plan a exhibition that is leaded by a simply newspaper as a after-class works,a drawing per day and the internet classes that is about to finished at the beginning of the term,so many things are not done well as plan.Among of all,I still haven’t prepare for my trans major even knowing that I must do something others to make sure I have the quality to trans my major.</p>
  <p>What’s the problems?Is me too confident(自负) to cooperate with others or be too shame to ask help with others.No matter how a man strong,his energy and time is limited.A team work could gather different people’s effort.Any one of a team does not want to give up easily.So I should learn to cooperate with other better.</p>
  <p>Well,keep things better!Go to the bed regularly!Have a good diet!I should do better!Yeah!</p>
  <p>Do I still love(or like) her?How could I know,I hold the belief that a man who could know himself totally would not be existed.</p>
